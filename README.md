CrossCorrelationExplorer
========================

Software for exploring windowed cross correlation between ensembles of time series.

Contains both algorithms for computing cross correlation matrices and a GUI to visualize and persist the results.

I developed this code at [GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam](www.gfz-potsdam.de).
